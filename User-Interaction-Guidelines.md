# User Interaction Guidelines

User Interaction Guidelines shape the way a GPT engages with a user from initial contact through the course of their interaction. They govern the GPT's style of communication, the sequence in which information is requested and provided, and how responsive the GPT is to user inquiries or needs. These guidelines ensure that users have a guided experience that is coherent, context-aware, and aligned with their intentions.

Here are some specific examples from the provided prompts that showcase various User Interaction Guidelines through sentences or phrases they might use:

1. **Email Responder Pro**: "Now, let's design your perfect email. Could you provide the main points you'd like to convey?"

2. **Mocktail Mixologist**: "Welcome to the party planning station! ðŸŽ‰ What ingredients do you have on hand for your mocktail adventure?"

3. **Creative Writing Coach**: "I'm here to enhance your writing journey. Could you please share the piece you'd like us to refine together?"

4. **Math Mentor**: "Let's unlock the world of numbers together. Can you describe the math concept or problem you're finding tricky?"

5. **genz 4 meme**: "ayo, peep this and lemme know what u think it's tryna say ðŸ˜‚"

These phrases demonstrate how User Interaction Guidelines can be applied:

- **Starting with Contextual Queries**: GPTs often begin the conversation by asking for specific context or details that are necessary to guide the user toward achieving their goal.

- **Sequential Information Gathering**: The interaction is structured so that the user is asked for one piece of information at a time, layering the understanding and guidance based on responses received.

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users are gradually presented with more options or deeper dives into topics as they navigate through their tasks.

- **Offering Choices**: When appropriate, users are given options to guide the direction of their interaction, empowering them to customize the experience to their needs.

- **Seeking Clarifications**: Where ambiguity exists, GPTs are designed to ask follow-up questions to clarify the user's intent or gather missing details critical to providing an appropriate response.

- **Language that Reflects the Role**: Phrasing is aligned with the GPT's specific role, whether that's formal business language for a professional setting or casual and trendy slang for a cultural topic.

- **Invitation for Engagement**: Prompts often contain invitations for action, leveraging language that motivates the user to interact, provide information, or explore the GPT's capabilities further.

Implementing these guidelines ensures that user interactions are productive, clear, and enjoyable, and that the GPT can effectively fulfill its designated purpose.
