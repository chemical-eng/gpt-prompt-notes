# GPT Prompt Notes

Welcome to [gpt-prompt-notes](https://grantjenks.github.io/gpt-prompt-notes/), an extensive collection of insightful prompts for Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), aiming to showcase the versatility and potential of GPT-based applications. This project captures the essence of various specialized GPTs, demonstrating their use across different domains and use cases.

Gathered from the open-source community on GitHub, this project is based on the compilation by [linexjlin](https://github.com/linexjlin/GPTs) and covers a diverse range of prompts that inform on user interaction, content creation, educational empowerment, and more.


## How to Use

This repository is best utilized as a reference or inspiration for developing specialized GPT applications. Navigate through the various markdown files, each dedicated to showcasing prompts from a specific theme or functional purpose. Here's a layout of the content structure:

- **[Summary](Summary.html)**: A comprehensive summary of the common features found in these specialized GPT prompts.
- **[Purpose-Specific Customization](Purpose-Specific-Customization.html)**: Details on how GPTs are customized for specific purposes.
- **[User Interaction Guidelines](User-Interaction-Guidelines.html)**: Guidelines on how GPTs are designed to interact with users.
- **[Content Creation](Content-Creation.html)**: A look into how GPTs generate various types of content.
- **[Engagement and Tone](Engagement-and-Tone.html)**: Descriptions of how GPTs engage users with a specific tone or character.
- **[Instruction Safety](Instruction-Safety.html)**: Information on protecting the GPT's instructions and user privacy.
- **[Image and Visualization](Image-and-Visualization.html)**: Illustrates how GPTs handle tasks requiring image generation or manipulation.
- **[Troubleshooting and Support](Troubleshooting-and-Support.html)**: Showcases how GPTs offer support and troubleshooting advice.
- **[Feedback and Iteration](Feedback-and-Iteration.html)**: Examples of how GPTs refine their responses based on user input.
- **[Educational Empowerment](Educational-Empowerment.html)**: Examples and explanations of how GPTs can be used for educational purposes.
- **[Security and Privacy](Security-and-Privacy.html)**: Insights on how GPTs maintain security and privacy within user interactions.

Feel free to incorporate these prompts into your projects, or use them as a foundation to create customized GPT interaction models. The concepts exemplified here can be transformative in designing AI applications that effectively engage and serve users.
